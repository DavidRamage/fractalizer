# Fractalizer
Fractalizer is a fun little Python tool that generates images from a few well-known fractals.
## About
A while ago when I was talking to some friends the topic of fractals came up.  Using ChatGPT
to generate code has also been a common topic.  I decided that it would be fun to have
ChatGPT generate some code to draw some of the more commonly known fractals.
## Dependencies
 - Turtle
 - Click

## Known Issues
Turtle is pretty slow, and I think it's intentional.  This means that the Mandelbrodt and Julia
sets take a while to draw.  There probably are other things too.
